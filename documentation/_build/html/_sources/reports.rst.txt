Reports
=======

The report consists of five parts.

    - Tail Detection
    - Goodness-of-Fit Tests
    - Fit Values
    - Risk assessment
    - Plots

Tail Detection
--------------
In this part contains the size of the data set that was analyzed, the minimal value for the :math:`AU^2` as well as information on the estimated tail.


Goodness-of-Fit Tests
---------------------

Goodness-of-Fit values for the Cramér-von Mises and Anderson-Darling teststatistics.

Fit Values
----------

Fitted values of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD).

Risk assessment
---------------

This part contains the Value-at-Risk and the Conditional-Value-at-Risk for the 0.95, 0.97, 0.99 and 0.999 quantiles.

Plots
-----

A plot of the input data, a plot of the three teststatistics (:math:`AU^2`, Cramér-von Mises and Anderson-Darling) for the different tails and a plot of the fitted tail.
