Welcome to FindTheTail's documentation!
=======================================

Find The Tail is a procedure that is able to separate a given data set into subsets which belong to the body or the tail of an unknown underlying parent distribution. The data belonging to the tail are used to fit a generalized Pareto distribution as tail model.
The tail model is evaluated further to determine the high quantiles, for risk assessment.
